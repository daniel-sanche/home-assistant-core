- get ssl support working (e2e encryption)
- add tests
- build flutter ui on top of database
- does the entity naming make sense? (should they be tied to device uid?)
- how are hosts uniquely identified? (right now, use the config flow entry as uid)
- improve batching (should updates be live by default?)
- let user change config details without deleting and restarting (add new entities, etc)
