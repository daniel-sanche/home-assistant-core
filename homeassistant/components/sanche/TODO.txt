- get ssl support working (e2e encryption)
- add tests
- build flutter ui on top of database
- does the entity naming make sense? (should they be tied to device uid?)
- how are hosts uniquely identified? (right now, use the config flow entry as uid)
- improve batching (should updates be live by default?)
- check auth in config flow (https://github.com/home-assistant/example-custom-config/blob/master/custom_components/detailed_hello_world_push/config_flow.py)
- implement reauthenticating https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/config_entries_config_flow_handler#reauthentication
- fix presubmit checks
